## Setup
From the root folder run:

```
npm install
```

## Create new Project with Ignite UI CLI
To get started with the Ignite UI CLI and Ignite UI for Angular:

```
npm i -g igniteui-cli
ig new <project name> --framework=angular
cd <project name>
ig add grid <component name>
ig start
```

## Adding IgniteUI for Angular to Existing Project

Including the `igniteui-angular` and `igniteui-cli` packages to your project:

```
ng add igniteui-angular
```

After this operation you can use the Ignite UI CLI commands in your project, such as `ig` and `ig add`.
[Learn more](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-cli#usage)

## Updating Existing Project

Analyze your project for possible migrations:

```
ng update
```

If there are new versions available, update your packages:

```
ng update igniteui-angular
...
ng update igniteui-cli
```

## Building the Library
```
// build the code
ng build igniteui-angular

// build the css
npm run build:style

// build them both
npm run build:lib
```

You can find the build ouput under `dist/igniteui-angular`.

## Running the tests

Running the tests in watch mode:

```
ng test igniteui-angular // or npm run test:lib:watch
```

Running the tests once with code coverage enabled:
```
npm run test:lib
```

## Building the API Docs
The API docs are produced using TypeDoc and SassDoc. In order to build the docs, all you need to do is run:

```
npm run build:docs
```

The output of the API docs build is located under `dist/igniteui-angular/docs`.

## Run Demos Application

The repository includes a sample application featuring the showcasing the different components/directives.
In order to run the demo samples, build the library first and start the application.
```
npm start
```

**NOTE**: Experimental demos are not always stable.

## NPM Package

You can include Ignite UI for Angular in your project as a dependency using the NPM package.

`npm install igniteui-angular --save-dev`
